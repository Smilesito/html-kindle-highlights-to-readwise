    Introduction: The Systems Lens
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Location 192
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    So, what is a system? A system is a set of things—people, cells, molecules, or whatever—interconnected in such a way that they produce their own pattern of behavior over time.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Location 221
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    Because of feedback delays within complex systems, by the time a problem becomes apparent it may be unnecessarily difficult to solve.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Location 231
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    A diverse system with multiple pathways and redundancies is more stable and less vulnerable to external shock than a uniform system with little diversity.
</div><div class="sectionHeading">
    Part One: System Structure and Behavior
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - One. The Basics > Location 341
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    system is more than the sum of its parts. It may exhibit adaptive, dynamic, goal-seeking, self-preserving, and sometimes evolutionary behavior.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - One. The Basics > Location 378
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    Many of the interconnections in systems operate through the flow of information. Information holds systems together and plays a great role in determining how they operate.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - One. The Basics > Location 389
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    The best way to deduce the system’s purpose is to watch for a while to see how the system behaves.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - One. The Basics > Location 524
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    A stock can be increased by decreasing its outflow rate as well as by increasing its inflow rate.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - One. The Basics > Location 531
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    stock takes time to change, because flows take time to flow. That’s a vital point, a key to understanding why systems behave as they do. Stocks usually change slowly. They can act as delays, lags, buffers, ballast, and sources of momentum in a system.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - One. The Basics > Location 535
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    Stocks generally change slowly, even when the flows into or out of them change suddenly. Therefore, stocks act as delays or buffers or shock absorbers in systems.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - One. The Basics > Location 555
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    Stocks allow inflows and outflows to be decoupled and to be independent and temporarily out of balance with each other.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - One. The Basics > Location 605
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    feedback loop is a closed chain of causal connections from a stock, through a set of decisions or rules or physical laws or actions that are dependent on the level of the stock, and back again through a flow to change the stock.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_blue">blue</span>) - One. The Basics > Location 631
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    balancing feedback loop,
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_blue">blue</span>) - One. The Basics > Location 631
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    Balancing feedback loops are goal-seeking or stability-seeking. Each tries to keep a stock at a given value or within a range of values. A balancing feedback loop opposes whatever direction of change is imposed on the system.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_blue">blue</span>) - One. The Basics > Location 668
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    reinforcing feedback loop,
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_blue">blue</span>) - One. The Basics > Location 669
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    It generates more input to a stock the more that is already there (and less input the less that is already there). A reinforcing feedback loop enhances whatever direction of change is imposed on it.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_blue">blue</span>) - One. The Basics > Location 694
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    Reinforcing feedback loops are self-enhancing, leading to exponential growth or to runaway collapses over time. They are found whenever a stock has the capacity to reinforce or reproduce itself.

</div>
<div class="noteText">
    The information delivered by a feedback loop can only affect future behavior; it can’t deliver the information, and so can’t have an impact fast enough to correct behavior that drove the current feedback.

    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Two. A Brief Visit to the Systems Zoo > Location 809
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    A stock-maintaining balancing feedback loop must have its goal set appropriately to compensate for draining or inflowing processes that affect that stock. Otherwise, the feedback process will fall short of or exceed the target for the stock.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Two. A Brief Visit to the Systems Zoo > Location 815
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    Every balancing feedback loop has its breakdown point, where other loops pull the stock away from its goal more strongly than it can pull back.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Two. A Brief Visit to the Systems Zoo > Location 866
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    When one loop dominates another, it has a stronger impact on behavior. Because systems often have several competing feedback loops operating simultaneously, those loops that dominate the system will determine the behavior.

</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Two. A Brief Visit to the Systems Zoo > Location 1056
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    Delays are pervasive in systems, and they are strong determinants of behavior. Changing the length of a delay may (or may not, depending on the type of delay and the relative lengths of other delays) make a large change in the behavior of a system.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Two. A Brief Visit to the Systems Zoo > Location 1099
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    In physical, exponentially growing systems, there must be at least one reinforcing loop driving the growth and at least one balancing loop constraining the growth, because no physical system can grow forever in a finite environment.

</div>
<div class="noteText">
    The trick, as with all the behavioral possibilities of complex systems, is to recognize what structures contain which latent behaviors, and what conditions release those behaviors—and, where possible, to arrange the structures and conditions to reduce the probability of destructive behaviors and to encourage the possibility of beneficial ones.

</div>
<div class="noteText">
    When systems work well, we see a kind of harmony in their functioning. Think of a community kicking in to high gear to respond to a storm. People work long hours to help victims, talents and skills emerge; once the emergency is over, life goes back to “normal.”
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Three. Why Systems Work So Well > Location 1346
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    Large organizations of all kinds, from corporations to governments, lose their resilience simply because the feedback mechanisms by which they sense and respond to their environment have to travel through too many layers of delay and distortion.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Three. Why Systems Work So Well > Location 1354
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    Systems need to be managed not only for productivity or stability, they also need to be managed for resilience—the ability to recover from perturbation, the ability to restore or repair themselves.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Three. Why Systems Work So Well > Location 1371
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    This capacity of a system to make its own structure more complex is called self-organization.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Three. Why Systems Work So Well > Location 1413
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    Systems often have the property of self-organization—the ability to structure themselves, to create new structure, to learn, diversify, and complexify. Even complex forms of self-organization may arise from relatively simple organizing rules—or may not.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Three. Why Systems Work So Well > Location 1447
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    Complex systems can evolve from simple systems only if there are stable intermediate forms. The resulting complex forms will naturally be hierarchic.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Three. Why Systems Work So Well > Location 1489
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    To be a highly functional system, hierarchy must balance the welfare, freedoms, and responsibilities of the subsystems and total system—there must be enough central control to achieve coordination toward the large system goal, and enough autonomy to keep all subsystems flourishing, functioning, and self-organizing.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Three. Why Systems Work So Well > Location 1492
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    Resilience, self-organization, and hierarchy are three of the reasons dynamic systems can work so well. Promoting or managing for these properties of a system can improve its ability to function well over the long term—to be sustainable. But watching how systems behave also can be full of surprises.

The consequence is overuse of the resource, eroding it until it becomes unavailable to anyone. THE WAY OUT Educate and exhort the users, so they understand the consequences of abusing the resource.

    THE TRAP: ESCALATION When the state of one stock is determined by trying to surpass the state of another stock—and vice versa—then there is a reinforcing feedback loop carrying the system into an arms race, a wealth race, a smear campaign, escalating loudness, escalating violence. The escalation is exponential and can lead to extremes surprisingly quickly. If nothing is done, the spiral will be stopped by someone’s collapse—because exponential growth cannot go on forever.

    THE TRAP: SHIFTING THE BURDEN TO THE INTERVENOR Shifting the burden, dependence, and addiction arise when a solution to a systemic problem reduces (or disguises) the symptoms, but does nothing to solve the underlying problem. Whether it is a substance that dulls one’s perception or a policy that hides the underlying trouble, the drug of choice interferes with the actions that could solve the real problem. If the intervention designed to correct the problem causes the self-maintaining capacity of the original system to atrophy or erode, then a destructive reinforcing feedback loop is set in motion. The system deteriorates; more and more of the solution is then required. The system will become more and more dependent on the intervention and less and less able to maintain its own desired state. THE WAY OUT Again, the best way out of this trap is to avoid getting in. Beware of symptom-relieving or signal-denying policies or practices that don’t really address the problem.

    one of the most powerful ways to influence the behavior of a system is through its purpose or goal. That’s because the goal is the direction-setter of the system, the definer of discrepancies that require action, the indicator of compliance, failure, or success toward which balancing feedback loops work. If the goal is defined badly, if it doesn’t measure what it’s supposed to measure, if it doesn’t reflect the real welfare of the system, then the system can’t possibly produce a desirable result.
