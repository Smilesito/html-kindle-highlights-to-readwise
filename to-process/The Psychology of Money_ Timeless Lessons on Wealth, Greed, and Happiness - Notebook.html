    Introduction: The Greatest Show On Earth
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Location 41
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    The premise of this book is that doing well with money has a little to do with how smart you are and a lot to do with how you behave. And behavior is hard to teach, even to really smart people.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Location 98
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    Money is everywhere, it affects all of us, and confuses most of us. Everyone thinks about it a little differently. It offers lessons on things that apply to many areas of life, like risk, confidence, and happiness. Few topics offer a more powerful magnifying glass that helps explain why people behave the way they do than money. It is one of the greatest shows on Earth.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Location 103
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    after the financial crisis was that no one could accurately explain what happened, or why it happened, let alone what should be done about it. For every good explanation there was an equally convincing rebuttal.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Location 105
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    Engineers can determine the cause of a bridge collapse because there’s agreement that if a certain amount of force is applied to a certain area, that area will break. Physics isn’t controversial. It’s guided by laws. Finance is different. It’s guided by people’s behaviors. And how I behave might make sense to me but look crazy to you.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Location 109
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    To grasp why people bury themselves in debt you don’t need to study interest rates; you need to study the history of greed, insecurity, and optimism. To get why investors sell out at the bottom of a bear market you don’t need to study the math of expected future returns; you need to think about the agony of looking at your family and wondering if your investments are imperiling their future.
</div><div class="sectionHeading">
    1. No One’s Crazy
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Location 122
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    People from different generations, raised by different parents who earned different incomes and held different values, in different parts of the world, born into different economies, experiencing different job markets with different incentives and different degrees of luck, learn very different lessons.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Location 134
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    Your personal experiences with money make up maybe 0.00000001% of what’s happened in the world, but maybe 80% of how you think the world works.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Location 239
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    It should surprise no one that many of us are bad at saving and investing for retirement. We’re not crazy. We’re all just newbies.
</div><div class="sectionHeading">
    2. Luck & Risk
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Location 252
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    Luck and risk are siblings. They are both the reality that every outcome in life is guided by forces other than individual effort.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Location 293
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    Luck and risk are both the reality that every outcome in life is guided by forces other than individual effort. They are so similar that you can’t believe in one without equally respecting the other. They both happen because the world is too complex to allow 100% of your actions to dictate 100% of your outcomes. They are driven by the same thing: You are one person in a game with seven billion other people and infinite moving parts. The accidental impact of actions outside of your control can be more consequential than the ones you consciously take.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Location 365
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    Be careful who you praise and admire. Be careful who you look down upon and wish to avoid becoming.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Location 371
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    Therefore, focus less on specific individuals and case studies and more on broad patterns.
</div><div class="sectionHeading">
    3. Never Enough
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_blue">blue</span>) - Location 397
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    For a critical element of our society, including many of the wealthiest and most powerful among us, there seems to be no limit today on what enough entails.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_blue">blue</span>) - Location 440
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    To make money they didn’t have and didn’t need, they risked what they did have and did need. And that’s foolish. It is just plain foolish. If you risk something that is important to you for something that is unimportant to you, it just does not make any sense.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_blue">blue</span>) - Location 446
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    1. The hardest financial skill is getting the goalpost to stop moving.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_blue">blue</span>) - Location 447
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    If expectations rise with results there is no logic in striving for more because you’ll feel the same after putting in extra effort. It gets dangerous when the taste of having more—more money, more power, more prestige—increases ambition faster than satisfaction.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_blue">blue</span>) - Location 452
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    Happiness, as it’s said, is just results minus expectations.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_blue">blue</span>) - Location 453
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    2. Social comparison is the problem here.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_blue">blue</span>) - Location 460
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    The point is that the ceiling of social comparison is so high that virtually no one will ever hit it. Which means it’s a battle that can never be won, or that the only way to win is to not fight to begin with—to accept that you might have enough, even if it’s less than those around you.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_blue">blue</span>) - Location 465
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    3. “Enough” is not too little.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_blue">blue</span>) - Location 467
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    “Enough” is realizing that the opposite—an insatiable appetite for more—will push you to the point of regret.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_blue">blue</span>) - Location 473
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    4. There are many things never worth risking, no matter the potential gain.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_blue">blue</span>) - Location 475
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    Don’t get too attached to anything—your reputation, your accomplishments or any of it.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_blue">blue</span>) - Location 478
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    Reputation is invaluable.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_blue">blue</span>) - Location 479

    Family and friends are invaluable.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_blue">blue</span>) - Location 480
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    Being loved by those who you want to love you is invaluable.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_blue">blue</span>) - Location 480
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    Happiness is invaluable.
</div><div class="sectionHeading">
    4. Confounding Compounding
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_blue">blue</span>) - Location 514
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    If something compounds—if a little growth serves as the fuel for future growth—a small starting base can lead to results so extraordinary they seem to defy logic. It can be so logic-defying that you underestimate what’s possible, where growth comes from, and what it can lead to.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_blue">blue</span>) - Location 557
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    The danger here is that when compounding isn’t intuitive we often ignore its potential and focus on solving problems through other means. Not because we’re overthinking, but because we rarely stop to consider compounding potential.
</div><div class="sectionHeading">
    5. Getting Wealthy vs. Staying Wealthy
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Location 604
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    Getting money is one thing. Keeping it is another.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Location 609
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    Getting money requires taking risks, being optimistic, and putting yourself out there. But keeping money requires the opposite of taking risk. It requires humility, and fear that what you’ve made can be taken away from you just as fast. It requires frugality and an acceptance that at least some of what you’ve made is attributable to luck, so past success can’t be relied upon to repeat indefinitely.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Location 618
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    The ability to stick around for a long time, without wiping out or being forced to give up, is what makes the biggest difference. This should be the cornerstone of your strategy, whether it’s in investing or your career or a business you own.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Location 620
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    There are two reasons why a survival mentality is so key with money.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Location 621
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    One is the obvious: few gains are so great that they’re worth wiping yourself out over.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Location 621
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    The other, as we saw in chapter 4, is the counterintuitive math of compounding.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Location 622
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    Compounding only works if you can give an asset years and years to grow.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Location 625
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    We can spend years trying to figure out how Buffett achieved his investment returns: how he found the best companies, the cheapest stocks, the best managers. That’s hard. Less hard but equally important is pointing out what he didn’t do.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Location 628
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    He didn’t sully his business reputation.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Location 629
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    He didn’t attach himself to one strategy, one world view, or one passing trend.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Location 631
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    He survived. Survival gave him longevity. And longevity—investing consistently from age 10 to at least age 89—is what made compounding work wonders. That single point is what matters most when describing his success.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Location 645
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    1. More than I want big returns, I want to be financially unbreakable. And if I’m unbreakable I actually think I’ll get the biggest returns, because I’ll be able to stick around long enough for compounding to work wonders.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Location 653
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    2. Planning is important, but the most important part of every plan is to plan on the plan not going according to plan.
</div><div class="noteHeading">

<div class="noteText">
    What’s the saying? You plan, God laughs.

    A plan is only useful if it can survive reality. And a future filled with unknowns is everyone’s reality.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Location 660
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    A good plan doesn’t pretend this weren’t true; it embraces it and emphasizes room for error. The more you need specific elements of a plan to be true, the more fragile your financial life becomes. If there’s enough room for error in your savings rate that you can say, “It’d be great if the market returns 8% a year over the next 30 years, but if it only does 4% a year I’ll still be OK,” the more valuable your plan becomes.

    Many bets fail not because they were wrong, but because they were mostly right in a situation that required things to be exactly right.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Location 664
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    Room for error—often called margin of safety—is one of the most underappreciated forces in finance. It comes in many forms: A frugal budget, flexible thinking, and a loose timeline—anything that lets you live happily with a range of outcomes.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Location 669
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    3. A barbelled personality—optimistic about the future, but paranoid about what will prevent you from getting to the future—is vital.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Location 692
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    A mindset that can be paranoid and optimistic at the same time is hard to maintain, because seeing things as black or white takes less effort than accepting nuance. But you need short-term paranoia to keep you alive long enough to exploit long-term optimism.
</div><div class="sectionHeading">
    6. Tails, You Win
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Location 710
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    “The great investors bought vast quantities of art,” the firm writes.¹⁹ “A subset of the collections turned out to be great investments, and they were held for a sufficiently long period of time to allow the portfolio return to converge upon the return of the best elements in the portfolio. That’s all that happens.”
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Location 717
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    A lot of things in business and investing work this way. Long tails—the farthest ends of a distribution of outcomes—have tremendous influence in finance, where a small number of events can account for the majority of outcomes.

    There is the old pilot quip that their jobs are “hours and hours of boredom punctuated by moments of sheer terror.” It’s the same in investing. Your success as an investor will be determined by how you respond to punctuated moments of terror, not the years spent on cruise control.

    There is a paradox here: people tend to want wealth to signal to others that they should be liked and admired.

    The wisdom in having room for error is acknowledging that uncertainty, randomness, and chance—“unknowns”—are an ever-present part of life.

But the downsides of those extremes—not being able to afford retirement, or looking back at a life spent devoted to chasing dollars—become enduring regrets.

    Go out of your way to find humility when things are going right and forgiveness/compassion when they go wrong. Because it’s never as good or as bad as it looks. The world is big and complex. Luck and risk are both real and hard to identify. Do so when judging both yourself and others. Respect the power of luck and risk and you’ll have a better chance of focusing on things you can actually control. You’ll also have a better chance of finding the right role models. Less ego, more wealth. Saving money is the gap between your ego and your income, and wealth is what you don’t see. So wealth is created by suppressing what you could buy today in order to have more stuff or more options in the future. No matter how much you earn, you will never build wealth unless you can put a lid on how much fun you can have with your money right now, today. Manage your money in a way that helps you sleep at night. That’s different from saying you should aim to earn the highest returns or save a specific percentage of your income. Some people won’t sleep well unless they’re earning the highest returns; others will only get a good rest if they’re conservatively invested. To each their own. But the foundation of, “does this help me sleep at night?” is the best universal guidepost for all financial decisions.

No matter what you’re doing with your money you should be comfortable with a lot of stuff not working. That’s just how the world is. So you should always measure how you’ve done by looking at your full portfolio, rather than individual investments. It is fine to have a large chunk of poor investments and a few outstanding ones. That’s usually the best-case scenario.

A gap between what could happen in the future and what you need to happen in the future in order to do well is what gives you endurance, and endurance is what makes compounding magic over time. Room for error often looks like a conservative hedge, but if it keeps you in the game it can pay for itself many times over.

    Avoid the extreme ends of financial decisions. Everyone’s goals and desires will change over time, and the more extreme your past decisions were the more you may regret them as you evolve.

    You should like risk because it pays off over time. But you should be paranoid of ruinous risk because it prevents you from taking future risks that will pay off over time.

    Respect the mess. Smart, informed, and reasonable people can disagree in finance, because people have vastly different goals and desires. There is no single right answer; just the answer that works for you.

    I like it simple. One of my deeply held investing beliefs is that there is little correlation between investment effort and investment results. The reason is because the world is driven by tails—a few variables account for the majority of returns. No matter how hard you try at investing you won’t do well if you miss the two or three things that move the needle in your strategy. The reverse is true. Simple investment strategies can work great as long as they capture the few things that are important to that strategy’s success.

    My investing strategy doesn’t rely on picking the right sector, or timing the next recession. It relies on a high savings rate, patience, and optimism that the global economy will create value over the next several decades. I spend virtually all of my investing effort thinking about those three things—especially the first two, which I can control.
