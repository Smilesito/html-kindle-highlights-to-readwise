    “A new idea comes suddenly and in a rather intuitive way,” Einstein once said, “but intuition is nothing but the outcome of earlier intellectual experience.” When people take insights from multiple sources and put them together, it’s natural for them to think that the resulting ideas are their own—as in truth they are.

    One of von Neumann’s great strengths was his talent—questioning, listening, gently floating tentative proposals, articulating, and collating—for being an impresario of such a collaborative creative process. Von Neumann’s propensity to collect and collate ideas, and his lack of concern for pinning down precisely where they came from, was useful in sowing and fertilizing the concepts that became part of EDVAC.

    most enduring challenge to the Turing Test, which was in a 1980 essay by the philosopher John Searle. He proposed a thought experiment, called the Chinese Room, in which an English speaker with no knowledge of Chinese is given a comprehensive set of rules instructing him on how to respond to any combination of Chinese characters by handing back a specified new combination of Chinese characters. Given a good enough instruction manual, the person might convince an interrogator that he was a real speaker of Chinese. Nevertheless, he would not have understood a single response that he made, nor would he have exhibited any intentionality. In Ada Lovelace’s words, he would have no pretensions whatever to originate anything but instead would merely do whatever actions he was ordered to perform. Similarly, the machine in Turing’s imitation game, no matter how well it could mimic a human being, would have no understanding or consciousness of what it was saying.

    “A human’s interests are determined, by and large, by his appetites, desires, drives, instincts,” said Braithwaite, who argued that to create a true thinking machine, “it would seem to be necessary to equip the machine with something corresponding to a set of appetites.” Newman chimed in that machines “have rather restricted appetites, and they can’t blush when they’re embarrassed.” Jefferson went even further, repeatedly using “sexual urges” as an example and referring to a human’s “emotions and instincts, such as those to do with sex.” Man is prey to “sexual urges,” he said, and “may make a fool of himself.”

    The billion-dollar question was whether PageRank would actually produce better search results. So they did a comparison test. One example they used was searching university. In AltaVista and other engines, that would turn up a list of random pages that might happen to use that word in their title. “I remember asking them, ‘Why are you giving people garbage?’ ” Page said. The answer he got was that the poor results were his fault, that he should refine his search query. “I had learned from my human-computer interaction course that blaming the user is not a good strategy, so I knew they fundamentally weren’t doing the right thing. That insight, the user is never wrong, led to this idea that we could produce a search engine that was better.”154
