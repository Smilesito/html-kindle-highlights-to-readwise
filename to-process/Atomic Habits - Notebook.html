    1: The Surprising Power of Atomic Habits

<div class="noteText">
    if you can get 1 percent better each day for one year, you’ll end up thirty-seven times better by the time you’re done. Conversely, if you get 1 percent worse each day for one year, you’ll decline nearly down to zero. What starts as a small win or a minor setback accumulates into something much more.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Location 258
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    But when we repeat 1 percent errors, day after day, by replicating poor decisions, duplicating tiny mistakes, and rationalizing little excuses, our small choices compound into toxic results. It’s the accumulation of many missteps—a 1 percent decline here and there—that eventually leads to a problem.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Location 282

<div class="noteText">
    Productivity compounds. Accomplishing one extra task is a small feat on any given day, but it counts for a lot over an entire career.

    Knowledge compounds. Learning one new idea won’t make you a genius, but a commitment to lifelong learning can be transformative.
</div><div class="noteHeading">

    Stress compounds. The frustration of a traffic jam. The weight of parenting responsibilities. The worry of making ends meet. The strain of slightly high blood pressure.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Location 295

<div class="noteText">
    Negative thoughts compound. The more you think of yourself as worthless, stupid, or ugly, the more you condition yourself to interpret life that way. You get trapped in a thought loop.

    Breakthrough moments are often the result of many previous actions, which build up the potential required to unleash a major change.

    “When nothing seems to help, I go and look at a stonecutter hammering away at his rock, perhaps a hundred times without as much as a crack showing in it. Yet at the hundred and first blow it will split in two, and I know it was not that last blow that did it—but all that had gone before.”
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Location 332
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    We often expect progress to be linear. At the very least, we hope it will come quickly. In reality, the results of our efforts are often delayed. It is not until months or years later that we realize the true value of the previous work we have done. This can result in a “valley of disappointment” where people feel discouraged after putting in weeks or months of hard work without experiencing any results. However, this work was not wasted. It was simply being stored. It is not until much later that the full value of previous efforts is revealed.

    The goal in any sport is to finish with the best score, but it would be ridiculous to spend the whole game staring at the scoreboard. The only way to actually win is to get better each day.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Location 373
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    Achieving a goal only changes your life for the moment. That’s the counterintuitive thing about improvement. We think we need to change our results, but the results are not the problem. What we really need to change are the systems that cause those results. When you solve problems at the results level, you only solve them temporarily. In order to improve for good, you need to solve problems at the systems level. Fix the inputs and the outputs will fix themselves.

<div class="noteText">
    The purpose of setting goals is to win the game. The purpose of building systems is to continue playing the game. True long-term thinking is goal-less thinking. It’s not about any single accomplishment. It is about the cycle of endless refinement and continuous improvement. Ultimately, it is your commitment to the process that will determine your progress.

    Chapter Summary Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement. Getting 1 percent better every day counts for a lot in the long-run. Habits are a double-edged sword. They can work for you or against you, which is why understanding the details is essential. Small changes often appear to make no difference until you cross a critical threshold. The most powerful outcomes of any compounding process are delayed. You need to be patient. An atomic habit is a little habit that is part of a larger system. Just as atoms are the building blocks of molecules, atomic habits are the building blocks of remarkable results. If you want better results, then forget about setting goals. Focus on your system instead. You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.

    2: How Your Habits Shape Your Identity (and Vice Versa)
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Location 423
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    Changing our habits is challenging for two reasons: (1) we try to change the wrong thing and (2) we try to change our habits in the wrong way.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Location 430
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    There are three layers of behavior change: a change in your outcomes, a change in your processes, or a change in your identity.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Location 431
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    The first layer is changing your outcomes. This level is concerned with changing your results:
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Location 433
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    The second layer is changing your process. This level is concerned with changing your habits and systems:
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Location 435
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    The third and deepest layer is changing your identity. This level is concerned with changing your beliefs:
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Location 440
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    Many people begin the process of changing their habits by focusing on what they want to achieve. This leads us to outcome-based habits. The alternative is to build identity-based habits. With this approach, we start by focusing on who we wish to become.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Location 449
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    With outcome-based habits, the focus is on what you want to achieve. With identity-based habits, the focus is on who you wish to become.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Location 466
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    It’s hard to change your habits if you never change the underlying beliefs that led to your past behavior. You have a new goal and a new plan, but you haven’t changed who you are.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Location 475
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    The ultimate form of intrinsic motivation is when a habit becomes part of your identity. It’s one thing to say I’m the type of person who wants this. It’s something very different to say I’m the type of person who is this.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Location 481
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    True behavior change is identity change. You might start a habit because of motivation, but the only reason you’ll stick with one is that it becomes part of your identity.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Location 482
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    Anyone can convince themselves to visit the gym or eat healthy once or twice, but if you don’t shift the belief behind the behavior, then it is hard to stick with long-term changes. Improvements are only temporary until they become part of who you are.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Location 507
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    The more deeply a thought or action is tied to your identity, the more difficult it is to change it. It can feel comfortable to believe what your culture believes (group identity) or to do what upholds your self-image (personal identity), even if it’s wrong. The biggest barrier to positive change at any level—individual, team, society—is identity conflict. Good habits can make rational sense, but if they conflict with your identity, you will fail to put them into action.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Location 539
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    Every action you take is a vote for the type of person you wish to become. No single instance will transform your beliefs, but as the votes build up, so does the evidence of your new identity. This is one reason why meaningful change does not require radical change. Small habits can make a meaningful difference by providing evidence of a new identity. And if a change is meaningful, it actually is big. That’s the paradox of making small improvements.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Location 553
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    New identities require new evidence. If you keep casting the same votes you’ve always cast, you’re going to get the same results you’ve always had. If nothing changes, nothing is going to change.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Location 555

    is a simple two-step process: Decide the type of person you want to be. Prove it to yourself with small wins.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Location 558
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    First, decide who you want to be. This holds at any level—as an individual, as a team, as a community, as a nation. What do you want to stand for? What are your principles and values? Who do you wish to become?
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Location 562
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    Ask yourself, “Who is the type of person that could get the outcome I want?” Who is the type of person that could lose forty pounds? Who is the type of person that could learn a new language? Who is the type of person that could run a successful start-up?

    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Location 574

    Your habits shape your identity, and your identity shapes your habits. It’s a two-way street.

    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Location 576

<div class="noteText">
    it’s important to let your values, principles, and identity drive the loop rather than your results.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Location 576

<div class="noteText">
    The focus should always be on becoming that type of person, not getting a particular outcome.

<div class="noteText">
    Identity change is the North Star of habit change.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Location 587
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    Ultimately, your habits matter because they help you become the type of person you wish to be. They are the channel through which you develop your deepest beliefs about yourself. Quite literally, you become your habits.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Location 589
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    Chapter Summary There are three levels of change: outcome change, process change, and identity change. The most effective way to change your habits is to focus not on what you want to achieve, but on who you wish to become. Your identity emerges out of your habits. Every action is a vote for the type of person you wish to become. Becoming the best version of yourself requires you to continuously edit your beliefs, and to upgrade and expand your identity. The real reason habits matter is not because they can get you better results (although they can do that), but because they can change your beliefs about yourself.

    3: How to Build Better Habits in 4 Simple Steps
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Location 627
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    After you stumble upon an unexpected reward, you alter your strategy for next time. Your brain immediately begins to catalog the events that preceded the reward. Wait a minute—that felt good. What did I do right before that? This is the feedback loop behind all human behavior: try, fail, learn, try differently. With practice, the useless movements fade away and the useful actions get reinforced. That’s a habit forming.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Location 637
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    Habits are mental shortcuts learned from experience. In a sense, a habit is just a memory of the steps you previously followed to solve a problem in the past.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Location 647
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    Habits do not restrict freedom. They create it. In fact, the people who don’t have their habits handled are often the ones with the least amount of freedom.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Location 655
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    The process of building a habit can be divided into four simple steps: cue, craving, response, and reward.*
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Location 666
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    Your mind is continuously analyzing your internal and external environment for hints of where rewards are located.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Location 668
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    Cravings are the second step, and they are the motivational force behind every habit. Without some level of motivation or desire—without craving a change—we have no reason to act. What you crave is not the habit itself but the change in state it delivers.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Location 671
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    Every craving is linked to a desire to change your internal state.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Location 675
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    Cues are meaningless until they are interpreted. The thoughts, feelings, and emotions of the observer are what transform a cue into a craving.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Location 676
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    The response is the actual habit you perform, which can take the form of a thought or an action. Whether a response occurs depends on how motivated you are and how much friction is associated with the behavior. If a particular action requires more physical or mental effort than you are willing to expend, then you won’t do it.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Location 680
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    Rewards are the end goal of every habit. The cue is about noticing the reward. The craving is about wanting the reward. The response is about obtaining the reward. We chase rewards because they serve two purposes: (1) they satisfy us and (2) they teach us.

    The four stages of habit are best described as a feedback loop. They form an endless cycle that is running every moment you are alive. This “habit loop” is continually scanning the environment, predicting what will happen next, trying out different responses, and learning from the results.*
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Location 699
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    In summary, the cue triggers a craving, which motivates a response, which provides a reward, which satisfies the craving and, ultimately, becomes associated with the cue.

    habit is a behavior that has been repeated enough times to become automatic. The ultimate purpose of habits is to solve the problems of life with as little energy and effort as possible. Any habit can be broken down into a feedback loop that involves four steps: cue, craving, response, and reward. The Four Laws of Behavior Change are a simple set of rules we can use to build better habits. They are (1) make it obvious, (2) make it attractive, (3) make it easy, and (4) make it satisfying.

    Before we can effectively build new habits, we need to get a handle on our current ones. This can be more challenging than it sounds because once a habit is firmly rooted in your life, it is mostly nonconscious and automatic.

    We need a “point-and-call” system for our personal lives. That’s the origin of the Habits Scorecard, which is a simple exercise you can use to become more aware of your behavior. To create your own, make a list of your daily habits. Here’s a sample of where your list might start: Wake up Turn off alarm Check my phone Go to the bathroom Weigh myself Take a shower Brush my teeth Floss my teeth Put on deodorant Hang up towel to dry Get dressed Make a cup of tea . . . and so on. Once you have a full list, look at each behavior, and ask yourself, “Is this a good habit, a bad habit, or a neutral habit?” If it is a good habit, write “+” next to it. If it is a bad habit, write “–”. If it is a neutral habit, write “=”. For example, the list above might look like this: Wake up = Turn off alarm = Check my phone–Go to the bathroom = Weigh myself + Take a shower + Brush my teeth + Floss my teeth + Put on deodorant + Hang up towel to dry = Get dressed = Make a cup of tea + The marks you give to a particular habit will depend on your situation and your goals.

    The labels “good habit” and “bad habit” are slightly inaccurate. There are no good habits or bad habits. There are only effective habits. That is, effective at solving problems. All habits serve you in some way—even the bad ones—which is why you repeat them.

    Chapter Summary With enough practice, your brain will pick up on the cues that predict certain outcomes without consciously thinking about it. Once our habits become automatic, we stop paying attention to what we are doing. The process of behavior change always starts with awareness. You need to be aware of your habits before you can change them. Pointing-and-Calling raises your level of awareness from a nonconscious habit to a more conscious level by verbalizing your actions.

    Broadly speaking, the format for creating an implementation intention is: “When situation X arises, I will perform response Y.”
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Location 959
</div>
<div class="noteText">

    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Location 974

<div class="noteText">
    Give your habits a time and a space to live in the world. The goal is to make the time and location so obvious that, with enough repetition, you get an urge to do the right thing at the right time, even if you can’t say why.

    When it comes to building new habits, you can use the connectedness of behavior to your advantage. One of the best ways to build a new habit is to identify a current habit you already do each day and then stack your new behavior on top. This is called habit stacking.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Location 1003
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    The habit stacking formula is: “After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT].”
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Location 1018
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    Habit stacking increases the likelihood that you’ll stick with a habit by stacking your new behavior on top of an old one. This process can be repeated to chain numerous habits together, each one acting as the cue for the next.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Location 1020

<div class="noteText">
    Your morning routine habit stack might look like this: After I pour my morning cup of coffee, I will meditate for sixty seconds. After I meditate for sixty seconds, I will write my to-do list for the day. After I write my to-do list for the day, I will immediately begin my first task.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Location 1035
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    Once you get comfortable with this approach, you can develop general habit stacks to guide you whenever the situation is appropriate: Exercise. When I see a set of stairs, I will take them instead of using the elevator. Social skills. When I walk into a party, I will introduce myself to someone I don’t know yet. Finances. When I want to buy something over $100, I will wait twenty-four hours before purchasing. Healthy eating. When I serve myself a meal, I will always put veggies on my plate first. Minimalism. When I buy a new item, I will give something away. (“One in, one out.”) Mood. When the phone rings, I will take one deep breath and smile before answering. Forgetfulness. When I leave a public place, I will check the table and chairs to make sure I don’t leave anything behind.

Brew a cup of coffee. Eat breakfast. Take the kids to school. Start the work day. Eat lunch. End the work day. Change out of work clothes. Sit down for dinner. Turn off the lights. Get into bed. Your list can be much longer, but you get the idea. In the second column, write down all of the things that happen to you each day without fail. For example: The sun rises. You get a text message. The song you are listening to ends. The sun sets.

    You can break a habit, but you’re unlikely to forget it. Once the mental grooves of habit have been carved into your brain, they are nearly impossible to remove entirely—even if they go unused for quite a while. And that means that simply resisting temptation is an ineffective strategy. It is hard to maintain a Zen attitude in a life filled with interruptions. It takes too much energy. In the short-run, you can choose to overpower temptation. In the long-run, we become a product of the environment that we live in.

    Chapter Summary The culture we live in determines which behaviors are attractive to us. We tend to adopt habits that are praised and approved of by our culture because we have a strong desire to fit in and belong to the tribe. We tend to imitate the habits of three social groups: the close (family and friends), the many (the tribe), and the powerful (those with status and prestige). One of the most effective things you can do to build better habits is to join a culture where (1) your desired behavior is the normal behavior and (2) you already have something in common with the group. The normal behavior of the tribe often overpowers the desired behavior of the individual. Most days, we’d rather be wrong with the crowd than be right by ourselves. If a behavior can get us approval, respect, and praise, we find it attractive.

Create an environment where doing the right thing is as easy as possible. Reduce the friction associated with good behaviors. When friction is low, habits are easy. Increase the friction associated with bad behaviors. When friction is high, habits are difficult. Prime your environment to make future actions easier.

</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Location 2340
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    Cardinal Rule of Behavior Change: What is rewarded is repeated. What is punished is avoided. You learn what to do in the future based on what you were rewarded for doing (or punished for doing) in the past. Positive emotions cultivate habits. Negative emotions destroy them.
</div><div class="noteHeading">

<div class="noteText">
    Every habit produces multiple outcomes across time. Unfortunately, these outcomes are often misaligned. With our bad habits, the immediate outcome usually feels good, but the ultimate outcome feels bad. With good habits, it is the reverse: the immediate outcome is unenjoyable, but the ultimate outcome feels good.

    chess, it is only after the basic movements of the pieces have become automatic that a player can focus on the next level of the game. Each chunk of information that is memorized opens up the mental space for more effortful thinking. This is true for any endeavor. When you know the simple movements so well that you can perform them without thinking, you are free to pay attention to more advanced details. In this way, habits are the backbone of any pursuit of excellence.

    You can’t repeat the same things blindly and expect to become exceptional. Habits are necessary, but not sufficient for mastery. What you need is a combination of automatic habits and deliberate practice. Habits + Deliberate Practice = Mastery

    Mastery is the process of narrowing your focus to a tiny element of success, repeating it until you have internalized the skill, and then using this new habit as the foundation to advance to the next frontier of your development.

    The process of mastery requires that you progressively layer improvements on top of one another, each habit building upon the last until a new level of performance has been reached and a higher range of skills has been internalized.

    Improvement is not just about learning habits, it’s also about fine-tuning them. Reflection and review ensures that you spend your time on the right things and make course corrections whenever necessary—like

    Each December, I perform an Annual Review, in which I reflect on the previous year. I tally my habits for the year by counting up how many articles I published, how many workouts I put in, how many new places I visited, and more.* Then, I reflect on my progress (or lack thereof) by answering three questions: What went well this year? What didn’t go so well this year? What did I learn? Six months later, when summer rolls around, I conduct an Integrity Report.

    My Integrity Report helps me realize where I went wrong and motivates me to get back on course. I use it as a time to revisit my core values and consider whether I have been living in accordance with them. This is when I reflect on my identity and how I can work toward being the type of person I wish to become.*

    When working against you, your identity creates a kind of “pride” that encourages you to deny your weak spots and prevents you from truly growing.

    The key to mitigating these losses of identity is to redefine yourself such that you get to keep important aspects of your identity even if your particular role changes.

    Men are born soft and supple; dead, they are stiff and hard. Plants are born tender and pliant; dead, they are brittle and dry. Thus whoever is stiff and inflexible is a disciple of death. Whoever is soft and yielding is a disciple of life. The hard and stiff will be broken. The soft and supple will prevail.
