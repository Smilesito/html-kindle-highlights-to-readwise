    PART I GOOD AND BAD STRATEGY
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Location 326
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    The most basic idea of strategy is the application of strength against weakness. Or, if you prefer, strength applied to the most promising opportunity.
</div><div class="sectionHeading">
    CHAPTER 1 GOOD STRATEGY IS UNEXPECTED
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Location 349
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    A good strategy has coherence, coordinating actions, policies, and resources so as to accomplish an important end.
</div><div class="sectionHeading">
    How Steve Jobs saved Apple
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Location 376
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    The power of Jobs’s strategy came from directly tackling the fundamental problem with a focused and coordinated set of actions. He did not announce ambitious revenue or profit goals; he did not indulge in messianic visions of the future. And he did not just cut in a blind ax-wielding frenzy—he redesigned the whole business logic around a simplified product line sold through a limited set of outlets.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Location 387
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    I carried out interviews with twenty-six executives, all division managers or CEOs in the electronics and telecommunications sector. My interview plan was simple: I asked each executive to identify the leading competitor in their business. I asked how that company had become the leader—evoking their private theories about what works. And then I asked them what their own company’s current strategy was.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Location 391
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    The standard story was that some change in demand or technology had appeared—a “window of opportunity” had opened—and the current leader had been the first one to leap through that window and take advantage of it.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Location 393
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    But when I asked about their own companies’ strategies, there was a very different kind of response. Instead of pointing to the next window of opportunity, or even mentioning its possibility, I heard a lot of look-busy doorknob polishing.

<div class="noteText">
    Good strategy requires leaders who are willing and able to say no to a wide variety of actions and interests. Strategy is at least as much about what an organization does not do as it is about what it does.
</div><div class="sectionHeading">
    CHAPTER 2 DISCOVERING POWER
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Location 502
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    The second natural advantage of many good strategies comes from insight into new sources of strength and weakness. Looking at things from a different or fresh perspective can reveal new realms of advantage and opportunity as well as weakness and threat.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Location 518
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    The story teaches us that our preconceived ideas of strength and weakness may be unsound.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Location 519

    CHAPTER 3 BAD STRATEGY
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Location 670
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    Once you develop the ability to detect bad strategy, you will dramatically improve your effectiveness at judging, influencing, and creating strategy.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Location 671
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    To detect a bad strategy, look for one or more of its four major hallmarks:
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Location 672
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    Fluff. Fluff is a form of gibberish masquerading as strategic concepts or arguments.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Location 674
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    Failure to face the challenge. Bad strategy fails to recognize or define the challenge.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Location 676
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    Mistaking goals for strategy.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Location 678
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    Bad strategic objectives. A strategic objective is set by a leader as a means to an end. Strategic objectives are “bad” when they fail to address critical issues or when they are impracticable.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Location 702
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    “All too much of what is put forward as strategy is not. The basic problem is confusion between strategy and strategic goals.”
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Location 748
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    Using words and slides, I told the group that many businesses did have powerful, effective strategies. But in my personal experiences with corporate practice, both as a consultant and as a field researcher, I saw a growing profusion of what I termed “bad strategy.”
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Location 752
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    Bad strategy is long on goals and short on policy or action. It assumes that goals are all you need. It puts forward strategic objectives that are incoherent and, sometimes, totally impracticable. It uses high-sounding words and phrases to hide these failings.
</div><div class="sectionHeading">
    How to recognize fluff
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Location 757
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    Fluff is superficial restatement of the obvious combined with a generous sprinkling of buzzwords. Fluff masquerades as expertise, thought, and analysis. As a simple example of fluff in strategy work, here is a quote from a major retail bank’s internal strategy memoranda: “Our fundamental strategy is one of customer-centric intermediation.” The Sunday word “intermediation” means that the company accepts deposits and then lends them to others. In other words, it is a bank.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Location 815
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    strategy is a way through a difficulty, an approach to overcoming an obstacle, a response to a challenge.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Location 815
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    If the challenge is not defined, it is difficult or impossible to assess the quality of the strategy. And if you cannot assess a strategy’s quality, you cannot reject a bad strategy or improve a good one.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Location 839
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    If you fail to identify and analyze the obstacles, you don’t have a strategy. Instead, you have either a stretch goal, a budget, or a list of things you wish would happen.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Location 917

<div class="noteText">
    Strategic objectives should address a specific process or accomplishment, such as halving the time it takes to respond to a customer, or getting work from several Fortune 500 corporations.

    A client has to first agree to engage in a dialogue before a tough back-and-forth can be productive.

    his plan, to me, was all results and no action. In his own mind, he believed in courage, boldness, motivation, and push.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Location 944
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    Motivation is an essential part of life and success, and a leader may justly ask for “one last push,” but the leader’s job is more than that. The job of the leader is also to create the conditions that will make that push effective, to have a strategy worthy of the effort called upon.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Location 971
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    Business leaders know their organizations should have a strategy. Yet many express frustration with the whole process of strategic planning. The reason for this dissatisfaction is that most corporate strategic plans are simply three-year or five-year rolling budgets combined with market share projections.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Location 973
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    Calling a rolling budget of this type a “strategic plan” gives people false expectations that the exercise will somehow result in a coherent strategy.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Location 980
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    To obtain higher performance, leaders must identify the critical obstacles to forward progress and then develop a coherent approach to overcoming them.

    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Location 981
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    This may require product innovation, or new approaches to distribution, or a change in organizational structure.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Location 983

    The leader’s responsibility is to decide which of these pathways will be the most fruitful and design a way to marshal the organization’s knowledge, resources, and energy to that end.

    Why not facing the problem creates bad strategy
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Location 990
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    Effective senior leaders don’t chase arbitrary goals. Rather, they decide which general goals should be pursued. And they design the subgoals that various pieces of the organization work toward. Indeed, the cutting edge of any strategy is the set of strategic objectives (subgoals) it lays out. One of the challenges of being a leader is mastering this shift from having others define your goals to being the architect of the organization’s purposes and objectives.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Location 993
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    To help clarify this distinction it is helpful to use the word “goal” to express overall values and desires and to use the word “objective” to denote specific operational targets.
</div><div class="noteHeading">

    Chen Brothers did not fall into the trap of believing that strategy is a grand vision or a set of financial goals. Instead, management had skillfully designed a “way forward” that concentrated corporate attention on one or two important objectives. Once accomplished, new opportunities would open up and more ambitious objectives could be set.

    Good strategy works by focusing energy and resources on one, or a very few, pivotal objectives whose accomplishment will lead to a cascade of favorable outcomes.

    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Location 1017

</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Location 1027
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    A good strategy defines a critical challenge. What is more, it builds a bridge between that challenge and action, between desire and immediate objectives that lie within grasp. Thus, the objectives a good strategy sets should stand a good chance of being accomplished, given existing resources and competence.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Location 1029
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    By contrast, a blue-sky objective is usually a simple restatement of the desired state of affairs or of the challenge. It skips over the annoying fact that no one has a clue as to how to get there.

    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Location 1032

    CHAPTER 5 THE KERNEL OF GOOD STRATEGY
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Location 1398
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    Good strategy is coherent action backed up by an argument, an effective mixture of thought and action with a basic underlying structure I call the kernel.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Location 1403
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    The kernel of a strategy contains three elements:
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Location 1404
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    1. A diagnosis that defines or explains the nature of the challenge. A good diagnosis simplifies the often overwhelming complexity of reality by identifying certain aspects of the situation as critical.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Location 1406
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    2. A guiding policy for dealing with the challenge. This is an overall approach chosen to cope with or overcome the obstacles identified in the diagnosis.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Location 1408
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    3. A set of coherent actions that are designed to carry out the guiding policy. These are steps that are coordinated with one another to work together in accomplishing the guiding policy.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Location 1428
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    All of these are supporting players. They represent ways of thinking about strategy, stimulating the creation of strategies, energizing groups of people, denoting specific sources of advantage, communicating, summarizing, and analyzing strategies, and so on.

<div class="noteText">
    The guiding policy outlines an overall approach for overcoming the obstacles highlighted by the diagnosis. It is “guiding” because it channels action in certain directions without defining exactly what shall be done.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Location 1521
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    Good guiding policies are not goals or visions or images of desirable end states. Rather, they define a method of grappling with the situation and ruling out a vast array of possible actions.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Location 1531

<div class="noteText">

    Good strategy is not just “what” you are trying to do. It is also “why” and “how” you are doing it.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Location 1534
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    A good guiding policy tackles the obstacles identified in the diagnosis by creating or drawing upon sources of advantage. Indeed, the heart of the matter in strategy is usually advantage.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Location 1536
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    Just as a lever uses mechanical advantage to multiply force, strategic advantage multiplies the effectiveness of resources and/or actions.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Location 1541
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    A guiding policy creates advantage by anticipating the actions and reactions of others, by reducing the complexity and ambiguity in the situation, by exploiting the leverage inherent in concentrating effort on a pivotal or decisive aspect of the situation, and by creating policies and actions that are coherent, each building on the other rather than canceling one another out.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Location 1569

<div class="noteText">
    There was no way to establish that this particular guiding policy was the only good one, or the best one. But, absent a good guiding policy, there is no principle of action to follow.

<div class="noteText">
    Yet the kernel of strategy—a diagnosis, a guiding policy, and coherent action—applies to any complex setting. Here, as in so many situations, the required actions were not mysterious. The impediment was the hope that the pain of those actions could, somehow, be avoided. Indeed, we always hope that a brilliant insight or very clever design will allow us to accomplish several apparently conflicting objectives with a single stroke, and occasionally we are vouchsafed this kind of deliverance.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Location 1630
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    Nevertheless, strategy is primarily about deciding what is truly important and focusing resources and action on that objective. It is a hard discipline because focusing on one thing slights another.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Location 1633
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    The actions within the kernel of strategy should be coherent. That is, the resource deployments, policies, and maneuvers that are undertaken should be consistent and coordinated.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Location 1634
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    The coordination of action provides the most basic source of leverage or advantage available in strategy.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Location 1650
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    What about a list of nonconflicting but uncoordinated actions? In 2003, I worked with a company whose initial “strategy” was to (1) close a plant in Akron and open a new plant in Mexico, (2) spend more on advertising, and (3) initiate a 360-degree feedback program. Now these actions may all have been good ideas, but they did not complement one another. They are “strategic” only in the sense that each probably requires the approval of top management. My view is that doing these things might be sound operational management, but it did not constitute a strategy. A strategy coordinates action to address a specific challenge. It is not defined by the pay grade of the person authorizing the action.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Location 1657
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    Strategic coordination, or coherence, is not ad hoc mutual adjustment. It is coherence imposed on a system by policy and design. More specifically, design is the engineering of fit among parts, specifying how actions and resources will be combined.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Location 1663
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    Strategy is visible as coordinated action imposed on a system. When I say strategy is “imposed,” I mean just that. It is an exercise in centralized power, used to overcome the natural workings of a system. This coordination is unnatural in the sense that it would not occur without the hand of strategy.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Location 1688
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    Thus, we should seek coordinated policies only when the gains are very large. There will be costs to demanding coordination, because it will ride roughshod over economies of specialization and more nuanced local responses. The brilliance of good organization is not in making sure that everything is connected to everything else. Down that road lies a frozen maladaptive stasis.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Location 1690

    In 1981, I was fortunate enough to spend a week with Pierre Wack at a Shell Group Planning retreat in Runnymede, England. Talking about scenarios, he told me: If you do standard “scenario” forecasting, you wind up with a graph with three lines labeled “high,” “medium,” and “low.” Everyone looks at it and believes that they have paid attention to the uncertainty. Then, of course, they plan on “medium”! But they are missing the risk. The risk is not that the price of oil may be high or may be low. The risk is that it will go high, suckering you into a major investment, and then turn and dive to low, leaving you with useless assets.

    Marco Tinelli explains how to get a chain-link system unstuck
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Location 2052
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    Marco Tinelli’s diagnosis was that his machinery company had chain-link logic and that it was stuck. Any payoff from better-quality machines was diluted because the sales force could not accurately represent their qualities and performance. A better sales force, by itself, would have added little value without better machines. And improvements in quality and sales would not save the firm unless costs were reduced.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Location 2055
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    “Where did you start?” I asked, echoing his own question. Marco explained:
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Location 2056
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    I conducted three campaigns, one after another. In the first campaign we spent twelve months just on quality. I told the employees that everything we did for the next year would be to make our machines the best in the industry, the most reliable and the fastest.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Location 2059
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    Once we had good quality machines, I focused entirely on the sales function. The salespeople had been involved in the quality campaign, and now the engineers and manufacturing people worked with sales to build skills, selling tools, and communications links back to the factory. Market results were slow in coming, but I knew we had to make these investments first to reap benefits later.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Location 2062
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    If one has not internalized the concept of quality matching and the problems of change in chain-link systems, then Marco’s explanation of his actions may seem banal—he identified the three problems and worked on them in turn. But if one has these concepts, then Marco’s statement is dense with meaning.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Location 2064
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    The first logical problem in chain-link situations is to identify the bottlenecks, and Marco did that—quality, sales’ technical competence, and cost.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Location 2065
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    The second, and greatest, problem is that incremental change may not pay off and may even make things worse. That is why systems get stuck. Marco’s solution to this problem was to take personal responsibility for the final result and direct others’ attention to the three bottlenecks, one after another.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Location 2069
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    There are little or no payoffs to incremental improvements in chain-link systems, but Marco avoided this problem by shutting down the normal system of local measurement and reward, refocusing on change itself as the objective.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Location 2077
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    Marco saw logical and temporal connections that dictated that the cost-reduction campaign come last:
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Location 2078
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    Finally, we spent nine months working just on cost. There was no other goal during this third campaign. I left cost cutting to the last because I wanted the cost-reduction campaign to work with, but not define, the type of machines we build.

</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_blue">blue</span>) - Location 2614

<div class="noteText">
    The problem with engineering growth by acquisition is that when you buy a company, especially a public company, you usually pay too much. You pay a premium over its ordinary market value—usually about 25 percent—plus fees. If you have friendly investment bankers and lenders, you can grow as fast as you like by acquisition. But unless you can buy companies for less than they are worth, or unless you are specially positioned to add more value to the target than anyone else can, no value is created by such expansion.

<div class="noteText">
    Two equally skillful chess players sit waiting for the game to begin—which one has the advantage? Two identical armies meet on a featureless plain—which one has the advantage? The answers to these questions is “neither,” because advantage is rooted in differences—in the asymmetries among rivals. In real rivalry, there are an uncountable number of asymmetries. It is the leader’s job to identify which asymmetries are critical—which can be turned into important advantages.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_blue">blue</span>) - Location 2694
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    No one has an advantage at everything. Teams, organizations, and even nations have advantages in certain kinds of rivalry under particular conditions. The secret to using advantage is understanding this particularity. You must press where you have advantages and side-step situations in which you do not. You must exploit your rivals’ weaknesses and avoid leading with your own.

<div class="noteText">
    The basic definition of competitive advantage is straightforward. If your business can produce at a lower cost than can competitors, or if it can deliver more perceived value than can competitors, or a mix of the two, then you have a competitive advantage.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_blue">blue</span>) - Location 2720
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    Subtlety arrives when you realize that costs vary with product and application and that buyers differ in their locations, knowledge, tastes, and other characteristics.

</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_blue">blue</span>) - Location 2723
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    Defining “sustainability” is trickier. For an advantage to be sustained, your competitors must not be able to duplicate it. Or, more precisely, they must not be able to duplicate the resources underlying it. For that you must possess what I term an “isolating mechanism,” such as a patent giving its holder the legally enforceable right to monopolize the use of a technology for a time.2
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_blue">blue</span>) - Location 2726

<div class="noteText">
    In thinking about change I have found it very helpful to use the concept of an attractor state. An industry attractor state describes how the industry “should” work in the light of technological forces and the structure of demand. By saying “should,” I mean to emphasize an evolution in the direction of efficiency—meeting the needs and demands of buyers as efficiently as possible. Having a clear point of view about an industry’s attractor state helps one ride the wave of change with more grace.

<div class="noteText">
    An attractor state provides a sense of direction for the future evolution of an industry. There is no guarantee that this state will come to be, but it does represent a gravitylike pull. The critical distinction between an attractor state and many corporate “visions” is that the attractor state is based on overall efficiency rather than a single company’s desire to capture most of the pie.

</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Location 3350

<div class="noteText">
    business, inertia is an organization’s unwillingness or inability to adapt to changing circumstances. Even with change programs running at full throttle, it can take many years to alter a large company’s basic functioning.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Location 3352
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    Were organizational inertia the whole story, a well-adapted corporation would remain healthy and efficient as long as the outside world remained unchanged. But, another force, entropy, is also at work. In science, entropy measures a physical system’s degree of disorder, and the second law of thermodynamics states that entropy always increases in an isolated physical system.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Location 3355
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    Similarly, weakly managed organizations tend to become less organized and focused. Entropy makes it necessary for leaders to constantly work on maintaining an organization’s purpose, form, and methods even if there are no changes in strategy or competition.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Location 3358

<div class="noteText">
    An organization’s greatest challenge may not be external threats or opportunities, but instead the effects of entropy and inertia. In such a situation, organizational renewal becomes a priority. Transforming a complex organization is an intensely strategic challenge. Leaders must diagnose the causes and effects of entropy and inertia, create a sensible guiding policy for effecting change, and design a set of coherent actions designed to alter routines, culture, and the structure of power and influence.

    The first step in breaking organizational culture inertia is simplification. This helps to eliminate the complex routines, processes, and hidden bargains among units that mask waste and inefficiency. Strip out excess layers of administration and halt nonessential operations—sell them off, close them down, spin them off, or outsource the services. Coordinating committees and a myriad of complex initiatives need to be disbanded. The simpler structure will begin to illuminate obsolete units, inefficiency, and simple bad behavior that was hidden from sight by complex overlays of administration and self-interest.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Location 3501

<div class="noteText">
    After the first round of simplification, it may be necessary to fragment the operating units. This will be the case when units do not need to work in close coordination—when they are basically separable. Such fragmentation breaks political coalitions, cuts the comfort of cross-subsidies, and exposes a larger number of smaller units to leadership’s scrutiny of their operations and performance.

    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Location 3504
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    After this round of fragmentation, and more simplification, it is necessary to perform a triage. Some units will be closed, some will be repaired, and some will form the nuclei of a new structure. The triage must be based on both performance and culture—you cannot afford to have a high-performing unit with a terrible culture infect the others. The “repair” third of the triaged units must then be put through individual transformation and renewal maneuvers.

    The chart I prepared for Carl and Mariah Denton is reproduced on the following page.

    Thus, the first bar on the left represents the best outlet in the chain—its GTO was $1.05 million per year. The next bar represents the GTO of outlet 1 plus that of outlet 2, a total cumulative GTO of $1.05 + 0.63 = $1.68 million. The third best outlet earned $0.5 million, so the third bar shows the cumulative GTO of outlets 1, 2, and 3 (1.05 + 0.68 + 0.5 = $2.18 million). Outlets 4 through 14 added another $2.5 million to the cumulative total, bringing it up to $4.68 million. But, beginning with outlet 15, negative GTOs begin to drag down the cumulative total. In fact, the negative GTOs of outlets 15 through 28 summed to negative $4.4 million, almost totally canceling out the contributions of the positive GTO stores. As you can see, the number one outlet’s GTO was higher than that of the whole chain of twenty-eight!

    The benefit of a faster cycle is that the product will be best in class more often.

<div class="noteText">
    A change in technology will often set in motion a change in industry structure. In this case, the relationship between the chip maker and the board maker altered. Interestingly, few foresaw the importance of this shift. A standard approach to such a problem in established industries would be to have certain board makers work directly with Nvidia’s emulators early in the development cycle. This, however, would increase a board maker’s bargaining power and the leakage of proprietary knowledge to rivals. With regard to Diamond Multimedia, Nvidia management believed that the shift from 2-D to 3-D graphics had eliminated most of Diamond’s traditional value added. Yet companies do not slide quietly into the darkness. Diamond should have made the deal with Nvidia, but it elected to try to maintain its high margins (about 25 percent). Standard industry analysis would classify powerful buyers such as Dell as a negative for Nvidia. But without powerful PC makers such as Dell and HP, Diamond might have maintained its hold on retail channels. It was the power of these concentrated buyers that allowed Nvidia to skate around Diamond’s established brand. Note that, in general, if you have a “me-too” product, you prefer fragmented retail buyers. On the other hand, if you have a better product, a powerful buyer such as Dell can help it see the light of day.

    CHAPTER 16 THE SCIENCE OF STRATEGY
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Location 3916
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    Good strategy is built on functional knowledge about what works, what doesn’t, and why. Generally available functional knowledge is essential, but because it is available to all, it can rarely be decisive. The most precious functional knowledge is proprietary, available only to your organization.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Location 3918
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    An organization creates pools of proprietary functional knowledge by actively exploring its chosen arena in a process called scientific empiricism.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Location 3920

<div class="noteText">

</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Location 3920

<div class="noteText">
    A new strategy is, in the language of science, a hypothesis, and its implementation is an experiment. As results appear, good leaders learn more about what does and doesn’t work and adjust their strategies accordingly.

</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Location 3941
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    Where does scientific knowledge come from? You know the process. A good scientist pushes to the edge of knowledge and then reaches beyond, forming a conjecture—a hypothesis—about how things work in that unknown territory.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Location 3942
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    If the scientist avoids the edge, working with what is already well known and established, life will be comfortable, but there will be neither fame nor honor.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Location 3944
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    In the same way, a good business strategy deals with the edge between the known and the unknown. Again, it is competition with others that pushes us to edges of knowledge. Only there are found the opportunities to keep ahead of rivals. There is no avoiding it. That uneasy sense of ambiguity you feel is real. It is the scent of opportunity.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Location 3947
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    In science, you first test a new conjecture against known laws and experience. Is the new hypothesis contradicted by basic principles or by the results of past experiments? If the hypothesis survives that test, the scientist has to devise a real-world test—an experiment—to see how well the hypothesis stands up.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Location 3950

<div class="noteText">
    Similarly, we test a new strategic insight against well-established principles and against our accumulated knowledge about the business. If it passes those hurdles, we are faced with trying it out and seeing what happens.

    When engineers use a nice clean deductive system to solve a problem, they call it winding the crank.By this they mean that it may be hard work, but that the nature and quality of the output depends on the machine (the chosen system of deduction), not on the skill of the crank winder.

    If new insights or ideas are not needed, deduction is sufficient. There can be times when results are fine, when no new opportunities seem to have developed and no new risks have appeared. Then, the logical answer to the strategy question is simply “Keep it up, do more of the same.” But in a world of change and flux, “more of the same” is rarely the right answer. In a changing world, a good strategy must have an entrepreneurial component. That is, it must embody some ideas or insights into new combinations of resources for dealing with new risks and opportunities.
